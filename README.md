you are given [this image](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/layton/images/1/1f/UF015.png/revision/latest?cb=20110704123152)
and told to find the largest possible number of boxes there could be stacked combining all rows and columns looking at it from
any point of view. In the end the answer is 21.
